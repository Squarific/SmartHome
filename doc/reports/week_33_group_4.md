#Report - Week 33 - Group 4

##Attendees

Attended: Filip, Jens, Nisse, David, Thanh

Date: 03/05/2016, 04/05/2016

##Status

####Social Aspect:
Graphs can now be shared on your wall, and viewed by your friends.  
To share a graph, the user can simply click "Share Graph" on any graph in the "View Household" screen.

####Graphs:
In the "View Household" screen, the user can now select a household, sensor, and time period in order to see exactly what he or she wants.

####Admin Interface:
Seeing as we are giving priority to other parts of the project, the admin interface is currently on hold and will be completed later.

##Topics

####Ranking:
As an extra feature, we have discussed adding a ranking amongst friends.
The ranking would display how much energy has been used by your friends. 
The people with the lowest power consumption would be ranked above those who consume more electricity.  
This seems like a nice little feature that would not only improve the social aspects of SmartHome, but would also promote saving power,  
which is essentially what the website is made for.

####Homepage:
Another small little feature would be added to the Homepage.  
We feel that adding some general (real) data, for example average energy consumption of the whole userbase, would appeal new users.  
As a result, they would be more likely to register, which is of course what we want.

####Other extra features:
Some more extra features have been discussed, including real-time data and data prediction. No real decisions have been made concerning these features, though.

##Planning

####Ranking:
Nisse has started working on the ranking amongst friends. Normally, this shouldn't take too long and should thus be completed by next week.

####Homepage:
Thanh has started working on the additions to the Homepage. This should hopefully be completed next week.

####Graphs:
Graphs need more options for determining which data will be shown.  
Retrieving data for a single sensor, during a certain period of time should be easy.
