##Status

####Translations:
All features that have been fully added, now also have translations.

####Log In & Register:
Few minor bugfixes (mostly UI-focused)

####Footer:
Along with the translations, a footer has been added.  
This footer provides the necessary flag buttons for changing languages.

####Social Aspect:
Some small changes have been made to further update the Wall and Notifications menus. They should now show friend requests which can then be accepted, providing the ability to see each other's posts.

##Topics

####Social Aspect:
Some small decisions have been made about how the social aspect of SmartHome will function (concerning displaying notifications and friend requests)

####Presentation:
Following our sub-par presentation, we need to make an extra effort to ensure all requested features are present and work correctly.

##Planning

####Social Aspect:
The social aspect still needs some depth (sending friend requests, sharing graphs)

####Admin Interface:
The Admin Interface needs to be coupled with the back end.  
Currently, front end and back end both work, but are not coupled yet.

####Graphs:
Graphs need more options for determining which data will be shown.  
Retrieving data for a single sensor, during a certain period of time should be easy.
