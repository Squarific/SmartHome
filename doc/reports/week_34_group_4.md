##Status

####Ranking:
It is now possible to view your friends and see a ranking of who has the lowest usage. You can see total usage, but also the average per household and their amount of households.  
All friends will be listed in a table with the person with the lowest usage first.

####Graphs:
This week we made it possible to filter the graph data using different time periods. Getting multiple sensors onto one graph is now also possible by using tags.  
You can now choose between showing the usage in either the original format or in euros.  

####Friend Requests:
You can now search for friends by their username. Suggestions of usernames that start with your input will be displayed.  
Once all the possibilities are displayed you can choose who you want to add as friend.  
If you are already friends, it should be possible to delete your friend.

####Back End:
DAVID INVULLEN

####Small Changes:
Some pages now refresh correctly (for example when accepting a friendrequest), to maintain responsiveness.



##Topics

####Tags and Clustering:
A new update has been posted on BlackBoard, and we have decided to go with the clustering of data, grouping by high/medium/low power usage.  Tags will also be updated to fit in this concept.



##Planning

####Graphs & Clustering:
The graph filtering by time period or tag will be refined, so that it works with the new clustering feature that will also be added (hopefully during the weekend).

####Creating Households and Sensors:
Although this is not really supported by the simulation software,
adding households and sensors would be a vital part of SmartHome in a real situation, so we will be making sure these features work correctly.

####Tags:
Tags are already supported, but the front end does not visualise them very well yet. The editing of tags will also be added.

####Ranking:
A few small changes and fixes need to be dealt with before the Ranking feature is fully operational.

####User Search:
Just like the Ranking feature, the user search needs just a bit more work.

####Admin Interface:
When the other features are added and work as expected, we will be recommencing our work on the Admin Interface.

####Final Report:
During the previous presentation, we were told that our final report was not up to standards, so we will be investing some time to make sure the next report is better than the last one.
